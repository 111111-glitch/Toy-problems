# I've created three four files

# 1.index.html - This is the user's interface...It displays inputs for the basic salary and the benefits amount

# 2. netSalaryCalculator - Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

# NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

# 3. speedDetector- Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

# 4.studentGrades -Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

# A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
